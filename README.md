I am a highly dedicated geospatial solutions professional with experience spanning **surveying sciences, GIS development, and applied remote sensing** in both industry and research settings.

I specialize in **GIS software application development, spatial data infrastructures (SDI), LiDAR, 3D/AR geospatial solutions, and spatial analytics** for decision support.

My aspiration is to lead innovative geospatial projects that translate complex spatial data into practical tools for governments, industry, and communities, while mentoring the next generation of geospatial practitioners
